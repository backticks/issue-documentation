# Defect Example

## Here are my browser details: https://aboutmybrowser.com/rAuFhmwk
1. I went to http://ignitelab.net/ and I clicked the big "CONTACT" button up top. I entered my email address (mike@example.com) and I typed in "I'm looking for a website, can you help me!?". I then clicked "Send your Message"
2. I got an error message that said "Invalid email". I tried putting in mike@example.com again and clicked "Send your Message". I received the same error message. 
3. I expected the system to send Ignite Lab an email so they could contact me.

Here is a screenshot of what I'm seeing:
