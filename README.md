## Description
Ever get frustrated with using a website because something isn't working towards your expectations? Quite often in a project product defects or feedback will arise that you will want to provide to the development team. Developers appreciate your feedback, because they want to make sure the product works correctly. However, it's increasingly difficult for a developer to understand what you are doing as a user and how you interact with the system, without you properly describing your issue. The better you can adhere to the format the quicker developers can fix your issue. The following is how to properly document an issue.  

### Step 1
Web
Go to: https://aboutmybrowser.com and copy and paste a link to your browser details. 

Mobile: Take a screenshot of the current situation. 

### Step 2
Provide a description for the defect

1. What are the steps and inputs that the user completed?
2. What result did the user get?
3. (Defect) What they expect to happen? (Feedback) What would you like to happen that didn't happen?

### Step 3
Try to categorize the issue as a Defect or Feedback. The difference between the two is often debated on the web. However the fundamental difference between the two is answering question 3 as part of Step 2.
