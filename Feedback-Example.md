# Example of feedback

## Here are my browser details: https://aboutmybrowser.com/rAuFhmwk

1. I went to  and I clicked the big "CONTACT" button up top. I entered my email address (mike@example.com) and I typed in "I'm looking for a website, can you help me!?". I then clicked "Send your Message"
2. The pop-up disappeared, but then nothing else happened.
3. I expected that I would get an automatic e-mail from Ignite Lab saying someone would be in contact with me. I'm confused if the system actually logged my request.
